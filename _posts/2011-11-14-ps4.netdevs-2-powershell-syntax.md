In my previous posts in this series I discussed
[why you should care about PowerShell][0] and I pointed to some
resources to help you [get started with PowerShell][2]. This post will
describe the syntax of the [PowerShell][1] language by comparing it
with the syntax C#. [Recently][3] the
[PowerShell language specification][4] was released under the
community promise, so if you were so inclined you can now implement
your own version of [PowerShell][1] without fearing a lawsuit for
patent infringement. To summarize this post: When translating a piece
of C# code to [PowerShell][1] take what you
would normally write in C#, remove all the explicit typing and add a few
`$`'s here and there. The comparison is mostly presented in a tabular form showing the C# syntax
in the first column and the equivalent [PowerShell][1] syntax in the
second, followed with a description of the particular language construct
in the last column. Enjoy.

### Comments
C#           | PowerShell  | Description                        
-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------
 `//`        | `#`         | single line                        
 `/* ... */` | `<# ... #>` | multi line                         
 `///`       |             | single line documentation comments 

#### Comment documentation keywords
[PowerShell][1] is also blessed with comment-based help but
because it does not have any formating keywords and does not focus on
types, a lot of the corresponding keywords have no equivalent in the
[PowerShell][1] column. [PowerShell][1] supports more keywords than
the ones listed below for the entire story please use
[PowerShell][1]'s built in help: `help about_Comment_Based_Help` or the [online documentation][help]:

### Literals 
Literals are the same as in C# with a few minor differences:

- In [PowerShell][1] the backtick (`` ` ``) is the escape character:
  ``PS>"Quotes need to be escaped `""``
- [PowerShell][1] does not have `char` literals to create one you have
  to use a cast: `[char]"a"`.
- [PowerShell][1] multi-line strings also begin with the `@"` it 
  however has to be followed by a new line, furthermore the end mark
  is a `"@` which has to by put at the beginning of the line.
- Array literals are created using the array operator `,`. So
  `"Fred","Barney"` creates on array containing 2 strings.
- [PowerShell][1] distinguishes single quoted `''` and double quoted
  `""` string literals the former causes the string to be interpreted
  verbatim while the later is subject to string interpolation. Here's
  an example: 
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>"my $PSCulture is dutch"
My nl-NL is dutch.
PS>'my $PSCulture is dutch'
My $PSCulture is dutch.
]]>
</script>
- [PowerShell][1] supports `HashTable` literals of the form: `@{
  <name> = <value>; [<name> = <value> ] ... }`. Below you can see that
  `HashTable` literals can be split across multiple lines in which
  case the semicolons (`;`) after the name-value pair can be omitted
  leaving a nice and readable `HashTable` behind.
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>$table = @{ a=37; b=42;}
PS>$ttable = @{
>>a=37
>>b=43
>>}
>>
PS>
]]>
</script>  

### Variables
In [PowerShell][1] variable declarations don't require explicit
typing, they do however have to be prefixed with a `$`.   
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>$now = [DateTime]::UtcNow
PS>$message = 'hello'
]]>
</script>
  
### Operators 
The arithmetic and assignment operators are the same for C# and
[PowerShell][1] the differences start with the comparison operators
the familiar `>` and friends are replaced with a `-` followed by an
abbreviation for the comparison. This was done to keep the meaning `>`
of for redirection as all system administrators now it from dos and
POSIX shells.

Apart from this table above there are a couple of extra operators that
have no C# equivalent:

- Redirection operators: 
  `>, >>, 2>, 2>&1`

- Comma operator: `,`  
  Creates an array.

- Split and Join operators: `-split,-join` 
  To divide and combine substrings
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>1,2,3 -join '*'
1*2*3
PS>$env:PATH -split ';'
%SystemRoot%\system32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\
&vellip; 
]]></script>

- Call operator: `&` 
  Run a command, script, or script block.

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\sha256sum.exe' test.iso
]]>
</script>

- Dot sourcing operator: `.`   
  Runs a script so that the variables, functions defined in the script
  are part of the calling scope.

- Static member operator: `::`   
  Used to call static method or retrieve
  static properties of a .NET Framework class.
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps">
<![CDATA[[Math]::Sin(([Math]::PI)/2)]]></script>

- Range operator: `..`   
  Represents the sequential integers in given an
  upper and lower boundary
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps">
<![CDATA[PS>1..10 -join ','
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]]></script>

- Format operator: `-f`   
  The following two pieces of code are equivalent (starting with C#):
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp">
<![CDATA[Math.PI.ToString("{0:0.00}")]]></script>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps">
<![CDATA["{0:0.00}" -f [Math]::PI]]></script>

- Subexpression operator: `$()`  
  Returns the result of one or more statements.
  Very handy in string interpolation like  
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps">
<![CDATA[
PS>"This machine has $([Environment]::ProcessorCount) cpu's"
This machine has 2 cpu's
]]></script>

- Array subexpression operator `@()`  
  Returns the result of one or more statements as an array.
  
### Selection Statements
[PowerShell][1] supports the `if-else` and `switch` statements.
The `if-else` differs only in the fact that [PowerShell][1] has a
`elseif` keyword where C# uses `else if`.

In [PowerShell][1] the `switch` statement has more functionality
compared to C# since it supports switching on regular expressions and
wildcards when the values supplied let themselves be converted to
strings. Again use `help about_Switch` (or look [here][switch]).
    
### Iteration Statements
<div class="code">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>C#</th><th>PowerShell</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>do {...} while (x &lt; 5 )</td>
<td>do {...} while ($x -lt 5 )</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for(int i=0; i &lt; 37; i++) {...}</td>
<td>for($i=0; i -lt 37; i++) {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>foreach(var i in Collection) {...}</td>
<td>foreach($i in $collection) {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&lt;command&gt; | foreach {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&lt;command&gt; | ForEach-Object {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>while(x &lt; 5) {...}</td>
<td>while($x -lt 5) {...}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Even though it's not explicitly mentioned in the table above
[PowerShell][1] also supports the familiar `break` and `continue` keywords. See `help
about_break` (or [here][break]) and `help about_continue` (or
[here][continue]) for details.

### Exception Handling
Since version 2 [PowerShell][1] supports the C# [`try-catch-finally`][tryc]
syntax besides the earlier introduced [`trap`][trap] keyword, which
can be viewed as a `catch` block with an implicit `try` for the
surrounding scope. [PowerShell][1] also supports [`throw`][throw], the
difference being that any expression can be [`throw`][throw]n. The expression
in the [`throw`][throw] syntax is optional, this reminds me a bit of the
[Perl][perl] [`die`][die] function.

### Functions
Functions in [PowerShell][1] are quite a different beast when compared
to C#. 

### Epilogue
This is my brief summary of the syntactic differences between C# and
[PowerShell][1]. I hope this can help you in coming to grips with
[PowerShell][1]. Next time we'll look at how easy it is to work with
XML in [PowerShell][1] and munge a large [MSBuild][msb] file with a
small script.
