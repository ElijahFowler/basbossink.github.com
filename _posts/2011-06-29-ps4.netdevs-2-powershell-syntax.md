In my previous posts in this series I discussed
[why you should care about PowerShell][0] and I pointed to some
resources to help you [get started with PowerShell][2]. This post will
describe the syntax of the [PowerShell][1] language by comparing it
with C# syntax. [Recently][3] the
[PowerShell language specification][4] was released under the
community promise, so if you were so inclined you can now implement
your own version of [PowerShell][1] without fearing a lawsuit for
patent infringement. To summarize this post I would take what you
would normally write in C#, remove all the explicit typing add a few
`$`'s here and there and you have learned how to write
[PowerShell][1]. What follows is a set of tables showing the C# syntax
in the second column and the equivalent [PowerShell][1] syntax in the
third preceded with a description of the particular language construct
in the first column. Enjoy.

### Comments
Description                        | C#          | PowerShell  |
-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
single line                        | `//`        | `#`         |
multi line                         | `/* ... */` | `<# ... #>` |
single line documentation comments | `///`       |             |

#### Comment documentation keywords
[PowerShell][1] is also blessed with comment-based help but
because it does not have any formating keywords and does not focus on
types, a lot of the corresponding keywords have no equivalent in the
[PowerShell][1] column. [PowerShell][1] supports more keywords than
the ones listed below for the entire story please use
[PowerShell][1]'s built in help:

### Operators 
The arithmetic and assignment operators are the same for C# and
[PowerShell][1] the differences start with the comparison operators
the familiar `>` and friends are replaced with a `-` followed by an
abbreviation for the comparison. This was done to keep the meaning `>`
of for redirection as all system administrators now it from dos and
POSIX shells.

| C#           | PowerShell  | Description                 |
|--------------+-------------+-----------------------------|
| `==`         | `-eq`       |                             |
| `!=`         | `-ne`       |                             |
| `>`          | `-gt`       |                             |
| `<`          | `-lt`       |                             |
| `<=`         | `-le`       |                             |
| `>=`         | `-ge`       |                             |
|              | `-match`    | regular expression matching |
|              | `-notmatch` |                             |
|              | `-like`     | wildcard pattern matching   |
|              | `-notlike`  |                             |
|              | `-replace`  | replace regular expressions |
| `$\mid$`     | `-bOR`      |                             |
| `&`          | `-bAND`     |                             |
| `^`          | `-bXOR`     |                             |
| `~`          | `-bNOT`     |                             |
| `&&`         | `-and`      |                             |
| `$\mid\mid$` | `-or`       |                             |
|              | `-xor`      |                             |
| `!`          | `!`,`-not`  |                             |

| `as`         | `-as`       |                             |

Apart from this table above there are a lot of extra operators that
have no C# equivalent
- Redirection Operators: `>, >>, 2>, 2>&1`
- Split and Join Operators: `-split,-join` to divide and combine
  substrings
- Call operator: `&` run a command, script, or script block.
  `& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\sha256sum.exe' test.iso`


### Control flow
All basic control flow statements you would expect are present in
[PowerShell][1] the `switch` statement has some more functionality
compared to C# since it supports switching on regular expressions and
wildcards when the values supplied let themselves be converted to
strings. Again use

    help about_Switch
    
### Iteration Statements

C#                                    PowerShell                                             
------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------
`foreach(var i in Collection) {...}`  `foreach($i in $collection) {...}`                    
                                      `<command> $\mid$ foreach {...}`                       
                                      `<command> $\mid$ foreach {<begin>} {<process>}{<end>} 
`for(i=0; i< 20; i) {..}`             `for($i=0; $i -lt 20; $i) {..}`                      
`while(true) {...}`                   `while($true) {..}`                                   
`do { ... } while(false)`             `do {...} while ($false)`                              
                                      `do {...} until ($true)`
