In my previous posts in this series I discussed
[why you should care about PowerShell][0] and I pointed to some
resources to help you [get started with PowerShell][2]. This post will
describe the syntax of the [PowerShell][1] language by comparing it
with C# syntax. [Recently][3] the
[PowerShell language specification][4] was released under the
community promise, so if you were so inclined you can now implement
your own version of [PowerShell][1] without fearing a lawsuit for
patent infringement. To summarize this post I would take what you
would normally write in C#, remove all the explicit typing add a few
`$`'s here and there and you have learned how to write
[PowerShell][1]. What follows is a set of tables showing the C# syntax
in the second column and the equivalent [PowerShell][1] syntax in the
third preceded with a description of the particular language construct
in the first column. Enjoy.

### Comments
Description                        | C#          | PowerShell  
-----------------------------------|-------------|-------------
single line                        | `//`        | `#`         
multi line                         | `/* ... */` | `<# ... #>` 
single line documentation comments | `///`       |             

#### Comment documentation keywords
[PowerShell][1] is also blessed with comment-based help but
because it does not have any formating keywords and does not focus on
types, a lot of the corresponding keywords have no equivalent in the
[PowerShell][1] column. [PowerShell][1] supports more keywords than
the ones listed below for the entire story please use
[PowerShell][1]'s built in help:

### Operators 
The arithmetic and assignment operators are the same for C# and
[PowerShell][1] the differences start with the comparison operators
the familiar `>` and friends are replaced with a `-` followed by an
abbreviation for the comparison. This was done to keep the meaning `>`
of for redirection as all system administrators now it from dos and
POSIX shells.

<div class="code">

Apart from this table above there are a couple of extra operators that
have no C# equivalent
#### Redirection operators: 
  `>, >>, 2>, 2>&1`
  
- Split and Join operators: `-split,-join` 
  To divide and combine substrings
  
- Call operator: `&` 
  Run a command, script, or script block.

<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps"><![CDATA[
PS>& 'C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU\GnuPG\sha256sum.exe' test.iso
]]>
</script>


- Dot sourcing operator: `.`   
  Runs a script so that the items in the script
  are part of the calling scope.
- Static member operator: `::`   
  Used to call static method or retrieve
  static properties of a .NET Framework class.
- Range operator: `..`   
  Represents the sequential integers in given an
  upper and lower boundary
- Format operator: `-f`   
  The following two pieces of code are equivalent:
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: ps">
<![CDATA["{0:0.00}" -f [math]::pi]]></script>
<script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: csharp">
<![CDATA[Math.PI.ToString("{0:0.00}")]]></script>
- Subexpression operator: `$()`  
  Returns the result of one or more statements.
- Array subexpression operator `@()`  
  Returns the result of one or more statements as an array.
  Comma operator: `,`  
  Creates an array.
  
### Selection Statements
[PowerShell][1] supports the `if-else` and `switch` statements.
The `if-else` differs only in the fact that [PowerShell][1] has a
`elseif` keyword where C# uses `else if`.

In [PowerShell][1] the `switch` statement has some more functionality
compared to C# since it supports switching on regular expressions and
wildcards when the values supplied let themselves be converted to
strings. Again use

    help about_Switch
    
### Iteration Statements
<div class="code">
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>C#</th><th>PowerShell</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>do {...} while (x &lt; 5 )</td>
<td>do {...} while ($x -lt 5 )</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>for(int i=0; i &lt; 37; i++) {...}</td>
<td>for($i=0; i -lt 37; i++) {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>foreach(var i in Collection) {...}</td>
<td>foreach($i in $collection) {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&lt;command&gt; | foreach {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>&lt;command&gt; | ForEach-Object {...}</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>while(x &lt; 5) {...}</td>
<td>while($x -lt 5) {...}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>


{% include date.inc %}
