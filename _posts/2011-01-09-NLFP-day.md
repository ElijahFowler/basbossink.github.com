Last friday I attended the [Nederlandse Functioneel Programmeren dag][nlfp]. 
The program showed a wide variety of short (20 min.) talks. This
appeared to be a nice low barrier of entry oppertunity to see what's
currently hot in the field of [functional programming][fp].
With the added benefit of being able to talk to people who get to use
languages like [Haskell][has], [F#][fs] on a daily bases instead of in
their spare time &#9786;.

### The talks

#### [Creating a Dataflow Processor in C&#955;aSH][dfp]

Anja Niedermeier presented a talk about designing a dataflow processor
using [C&#955;aSH][cash] a functional hardware description language that
borrows both its syntax and semantics from [Haskell][has]. The
interesting part for me was to see a parrallel to a question that was
recently posed at my current project to create some means to let users
create their own image processing pipeline from a given set of basic
operations.

#### [Functional Modeling of Musical Harmony][mus]

Jos&eacute; Pedro Magalh&atilde;es presented the way in which he and
his fellow researchers used [Haskell][has]
[Generalized Algebraic Datatypes][gadt] to model chord sequences. The
practical application of this work could for instance be recognising
music based on the found chord sequences. This talk was very
interesting to me since it combined the field of music with
programming [Haskell][has].  

#### [The Expression Problem in Clojure][cexp] 

Sander van den Berg presented a way to solve a reformulation of the
[Expression Problem][exp]. The expression problem was coined by
[Philip Wadler][wad] as an indicator of the capacity for expression of
a programming language. This was the only talk that featured a
[dynamically typed language][dyn], [Clojure][cloj] in this case. The
language features demonstrated were [protocols][prot] and
[datatypes][dat].

#### [Renjin: Towards a more pure, scalable R][renjin]

Alexander Bertram gave an interesting talk about his efforts to write
a Java-based [R][r] interpreter and compiler. [R][r] is language with
a large history, created and maintained mostly by statisticians and
data-analysts. This accounts for the large number of language
features, some of which make computer scientists curl their toes.
[R][r] is a functional language in which even if and break are
functions, that can even be redefined, aaah. Running R in the 'cloud'
is the ultimate goal, to provide a solution for datamining very large
datasets.

#### [jQuery Programming with Haskell][jqhas]

After lunch Jurri&euml;n Stutterheim presented the way one can
currently use the [Utrecht Haskell Compiler][uhc] to compile [Haskell][has]
code to JavaScript and how one can use the popular [jQuery][jq]
library from within [Haskell][has]. The demo was cool, there were
still some hurdles to overcome however. The use of optional parameters
is one of them. I couldn't help but wonder why some many people fight
JavaScript. In my opinion we should just take it's good parts and use
it's dynamic nature to our benefit and fight the errorproneness of the
dynamicism with a sufficient set of unit tests, and right-sizing of
view code using presentation patterns like [Model View ViewModel][mvvm].

#### [From Clean to JavaScript via Sapl][clja]

Jan Martin Jansen presented efforts to build a [Clean][clean] to
JavaScript compiler. This talk discussed in technical detail how some
JavaScript constructs could be translated to Sapl (an intermediate
language used by the [Clean][clean] compiler) which in it's turn can
be compiled to native code.
